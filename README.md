You should be working within this group on the key tasks set each week. During week 7 you will deliver a 10 minutes poster presentation from your group on the below:Identify one journal article within the field of business  management. Conduct a critical evaluation of the journal article which will be presented in the form. of an academic presentation.· Select an academic journal article published within the past five years.· Your journal article should consider ‘employability or talent or career in your chosen area of interest (e.g., Marketing, HR, Finance) or broader field (Business administration, Management).· Download the pdf of the article to your own computer/memory stick so that you have a permanent copy.In the academic presentation, present the following 3 areas:(1) Identify the source(s) of information you used for identifying the journal article.(2) Discuss the credibility of the chosen source(s) of information.(3) Discuss the journal article in the format given below:[a] Introduce the audience to the specific subject of the journal article and provide an overview of the current state of the research field.[b] The research questions addressed in the journal paper are clearly identified, explicitly stated, and connected to the introduction.[c] The implications of the findings are discussed, both for the specific research field and for organizations/managers.[d] Merits of the journal article and potential shortcomings are identified and discussed.ASSESSMENT2: Individual Reflective CommentaryGeneral Information(1) This is a reflective commentary and should be written in the first person.(2) You should select a career which you feel is most meaningful and appropriate for your personal circumstances. This can include, if appropriate, working for your family business, setting up or developing your own business, or progressing your career in an organisation for which you already work.(3) Whichever career you choose, it should be specific. For example, ‘Manager’ and ‘Business Consultant’ are too vague and broad. ‘HR Business Partner in a sales-focused organisation,’ ‘Business Consultant in the renewables sector,’ or ‘Depot Manager at DPD,’ are all more appropriate choices. The more specific you can be, the easier it will be to understand the precise requirements of your career and what you need to do in order to meet these requirements in the future.(4) For the specific career you choose, determine the skills, attributes, knowledge, and experience required for long-term success within it.(5) Now talk about your planned journey to position yourself for this career choice. This will require you to underpin the claims you make about yourself with supporting evidence in the form. of appendices. You will refer to these in your discussion so that your commentary is underpinned with believable real-life evidence drawn from this module and elsewhere. For example, if you are interested in a career in ‘Managing Compensation and Benefits in a Manufacturing Organization’ and conclude that your development needs are around ‘becoming proficient with Human Resource Information Systems’, you need to develop a career development plan that allows you to become more adeptin important HR systems. You will also discuss what learning style. (s) will be adopted so that you can learn more about HR systems.(6) Appendices can be drawn from many different sources, including personal networking plan and activity feedback from this module; Feedback from your line manager at work; Project activities for other university modules and beyond. Be creative! Include a rich range of appendices which are especially relevant to you.(7) All appendices should be professionally presented at the end of your submission. Please DON NOT include links to them in your document as they cannot be accessed directly from Turnitin during the marking process. Feel free to include readable screenshots of items where necessary.
